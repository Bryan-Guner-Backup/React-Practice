          <h2>Just The UI</h2>
          <p>Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.</p>

          <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>
          <p>React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance. It can also render on the server using Node.js — no heavy browser DOM required.</p>

          <h2>Data Flow</h2>
          <p>React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.</p>

          <h2>Handlebars</h2>
          <p>Write dramatically less code with Ember's Handlebars integrated templates that update automatically when the underlying data changes.</p>

          <h2>Architecture</h2>
          <p>Don't waste time making trivial choices. Ember.js incorporates common idioms so you can focus on what makes your app special, not reinventing the wheel.</p>

          <h2>Productivity</h2>
          <p>Ember.js is built for productivity. Designed with developer ergonomics in mind, its friendly APIs help you get your job done—fast.</p>

          <h2>Why AngularJS?</h2>
          <p>HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.</p>

          <h2>Alternatives</h2>
          <p>Other frameworks deal with HTML’s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. Neither of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.</p>

          <h2>Extensibility</h2>
          <p>AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs. Read on to find out how.</p>

          <p>Yoshi (ヨッシー Yosshī?) /ˈjoʊʃi/ or /ˈjɒʃi/, once romanized as Yossy, is a fictional anthropomorphic dinosaur (referred to as a dragon at times) who appears in video games published by Nintendo. He debuted in Super Mario World (1990) on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as Mario and Luigi's sidekick (a role he has often reprised), and he later established his own series with several platform and puzzle games, including Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. He has also appeared in many of the spin-off Mario games including the Mario Party, the Mario Kart, and the Super Smash Bros. series, as well as in other various Mario sports titles. Yoshi also appears in New Super Mario Bros. Wii (2009) as the characters' companion and steed, similar to his original debut role in Super Mario World. Yoshi belongs to the species of the same name which comes in various colors, with green being the most common.</p>
